# MicroShield BPO Website

MicroShield BPO is a static website for a BPO and customer experience services brand. The site includes a responsive homepage, service sections, industry coverage, proof metrics, case studies, and a front-end contact form interaction.

## What Is Included

- `index.html` for website content and page structure
- `assets/css/styles.css` for responsive layout and visual styling
- `assets/js/main.js` for navigation and contact form behavior
- `scripts/build.js` to generate the static `dist/` output
- `scripts/test.js` to validate the generated static files

## Run Locally

Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or serve the project with any local static file server.

## Build And Test

```bash
npm ci
npm test
```

The `npm test` command runs the build first and then checks that the generated `dist/` output contains the expected HTML, CSS, and JavaScript assets.

## Customize

- Update page copy and sections in `index.html`
- Update colors, spacing, and responsive behavior in `assets/css/styles.css`
- Connect the contact form to an API or CRM in `assets/js/main.js`
